THIS IS BEATLOCKER GLOBAL PROJECT vs BITLOCKER

Hundred thousands of Windows users around the globe are in hell because BitLocker encrypted their drives, often unwillingly, making them anymore accessible to them: ruined businesses and lives. That so called security software turned out to be a self-destruction device, which is wrong from every angle, the entire BitLocker system seems flawed and must be destroyed.

This project aims to reunite mathematicians (Shor's algorithm), cryptologists, cryptanalysts, security engineers, quantum computer engineers, hackers to reach its goal.
Just like Alan Turing at his time broke Enigma code during the Second World War, yes, together we can and we will beat and break Bitlocker!

For more information about Bitlocker, here an article explaining it quite well:
